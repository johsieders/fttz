    "We consider binary trees. Each node has a value, a left subtree, and a right subtree.\n",

    "left and right subtrees being `None` or a triple of the same type. That's a recursive data structure.\n",
    "An important convention is about the empty tree:\n",
    "The empty tree is just `None`; a subtree with one only node is `(None, value, None)`\n",
    "A tree is represented by its root, so, there is no difference between a node and a tree.\n",

    "- **depth first**\n",
    "- **breadth first**\n",

    "There are six varieties of depth first, corresponding to six permutations of (left, value, right).\n",
    "\n",
    "Four of these have a name:\n",

    "- **preorder**: value, left, right\n",

    "- **no name**: left, right, value\n",
    "\n",
    "Traversing a tree breadth first is by layer:\n",
    "the root comes first (layer 0), then its children (layer 1),\n",
    "then their children (layer 2) and so on. Breath first is always top-down, and\n",
    "in general left to right, but right to left is equally possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us two types of programming tasks: convert a binary structure in\n",
    "a linear structure (preorder, inorder or whatever) and convert a linear structure back\n",
    "to a binary structure. The recursive version is often straightforward;\n",
    "the non-recursive variety uses stacks or decks.\n",
    "It can be less obvious but gives some insight in how trees behave."
